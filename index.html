			<h2>Background</h2>

			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<h4>Information on Organisation</h4>
      <p>According to 107 Project’s summary of activities on the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission; “[107 Projects] advances arts and culture by supporting artists and audiences to participate in creativity and experience cultural activities. We operate affordable, independent creative centres in Redfern and Zetland, curate creative programs, offer education projects and internships, produce public artwork commissions, fund artist residencies and partner with the community and private sectors to make social change. Each year we engage with more than 30,000 people, 3000 artists and 600 events … and provide $148k in subsidies to artists and community-focused groups.” (ACNC, 2020). On the 107 Project website, they state that their four main events are screenings, workshops, exhibitions and ‘107 presents’, which “takes audiences beyond the expected to experience a curated multi-arts program … [that] showcases Sydney as a creative city to live, work and play” (107 Projects, 2020).</p>

      <h4>Potential Groups of Users </h4>
      <p>The organisation boasts a large focus on disadvantaged or minority groups, including  (LIST) Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders, unemployed, disabled and LGBTQ+ (ACNC, 2020) </p>

      <p>107 Project focuses on both adults and children, with workshops for both, as well as clearly marked child-friendly and 18+ only workshops and screenings. </p>

      <h4>Disabled</h4>
      <p> From the 107 Project Annual Report from 2019, it was seen that there was a large number of members who came from the Auslan community. This means that this community will be a main focus of accessibility for a website for 107 Projects. </p>

      <p>“Friendly Website Design for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired”, a blog post from Deaf Texas, states that the five main points for greater inclusivity for deaf individuals are to: (LIST) use simple, clear language, provide imagery with written content (visual balance), include text-based transcripts and closed-captioning with audio and videos, provide avenues for further connection and direct communication and to honour ways that [the deaf or hearing impared] have felt left out. (deaftx, 2017) </p>

      <p>In addition, as this is a charity focusing on art, it will be less likely that visitors to the website will be visually impaired, and focus on designing a website for those with this disability will concurrently be less emphasised. </p>

      <h4>Children</h4>
      <p>Although 107 Projects has events for children, the audience that should be catered to when creating the website is actually the parents who will be browsing the website. According to “Designing your website for Millenial Parents: Dos and Don’ts of Engaging Design and UX”, a website targeting parents should contain images, block quotes and other graphic treatment, whilst not containing long blocks of text, instead being straight to the point (Angelo Otterbien, 2018).</p>

      <h4>LGBTQ+</h4>
      <p>LGBTQ+ are another major portion of 107 Project users, and thus have to be taken into consideration when creating a website for the organisation. The blog post, “How to Design an LGBTQ-Inclusive Website”, by DreamHost lists a few ways to make a website LGBTQ friendly, with the ones most relevant being: (list) use gender-neutral terms, include LGBTQ images, collect only the data you need and tell users what this data will be used for. (Ellise, 2018) </p>


			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Based on the background research and user profiles, a website for this organisation would need: clearly defined categories for the four main events, as well as labelled categories for events to sort them into child friendly and adult only. It would need to have good accessibility for the disabled, and have contacts/forms to sign up for the events. It may have a banner on the homepage to highlight current events, as well as categories grouping the events, which will also be easily found in the navigation bar.</p>

          <p> The sitemap and the user flow diagrams were done before the sketches but after the moodboard, and were useful in creating a full picture of how pages in my website would link to eachother, leading to a faster and more comprehensive experience in creating the sketches. </p>
